# AES Implementation in Pure Python

This repository contains a pure Python implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) without relying on any external libraries. AES is a widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm.

## Overview

AES operates on 128-bit blocks of plaintext and supports key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits. It uses a substitution-permutation network to perform encryption and decryption.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt plaintext using AES algorithm.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt ciphertext using AES algorithm.
- **Key Generation**: Generate random AES keys or provide custom keys for encryption and decryption.
